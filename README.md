Hi!\
I'm Jo√£o (quite unpronounceable, I know...), a computational chemist/biophisicist & data scientist.\
Here's a stop motion timelapse:
- Then - MD simulations and QM calculations (physics-based modeling, tons of data, tiny but complex systems doing strange things);
- Now - data science in the real world ("things I can talk with people about");
- In the meantime - python data science stack.

  This is where I'll post my non-academic work. In case you're interested in data science applied to chemical/biological systems at the molecular/atomic scale, check out my publications:\
