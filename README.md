Hi!\
I'm Jo√£o (quite unpronounceable, I know...), a computational chemist/biophisicist & data scientist.\
Here's a stop motion timelapse:
- Then - MD simulations and QM calculations (physics-based modeling, tons of data, tiny but complex systems doing strange things);
- Now - data science in the real world ("things I can talk with people about");
- In the meantime - python data science stack.
